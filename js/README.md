# idom-plotly-react

Plotly figures as a custom component for IDOM

# Package Installation

Requires [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed:

```bash
npm install --save idom-plotly-react
```

For a developer installation, `cd` into this directory and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

This will install required dependencies and generate a Javascript bundle that is saved
to `idom-plotly/bundle.js`` and is distributed with the
associated Python package.
